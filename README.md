```bash
# Download scripts
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vm-bootstrap/main/vm-install.sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vm-bootstrap/main/setup-dotfiles-ssh.sh

./setup-dotfiles-ssh.sh
```

### SSH Deploy Key Management
```bash
# Test SSH connection
ssh -T github-dotfiles

## üîß Customization

These scripts provide a solid foundation that works well for most developers. For personalized configurations:

1. **Run the bootstrap** - Get the essentials working
2. **Clone your dotfiles** - Use the SSH setup to access private configs  
3. **Run your install script** - Apply your personal configurations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### VM Install Issues
- **Package not found**: Some minimal containers may need additional repos
- **Permission denied**: Ensure you have sudo access or are running as root
- **Locale warnings**: Script handles this automatically with fallbacks

### SSH Setup Issues  
- **ssh-keygen not found**: Script auto-installs SSH tools
- **Connection failed**: Verify deploy key was added to GitHub correctly
- **Clone failed**: Check repository name and GitHub access

### Getting Help
```bash
# Check what was installed
which git nvim tmux zsh fzf

# Test zsh setup
zsh

# Test tmux setup  
tmux

# Test SSH setup
ssh -T github-dotfiles
```

## üìù What's Next?

After running these scripts:

1. **Switch to zsh**: Run `zsh` or log out/in
2. **Start tmux**: Run `tmux` for terminal multiplexing
3. **Use your dotfiles**: Your personal configs are now available
4. **Customize further**: Add any VM-specific configurations
